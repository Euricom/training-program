The roadmaps are original based on [https://github.com/adam-golab/react-developer-roadmap](https://github.com/adam-golab/react-developer-roadmap) and adapted to the Euricom Training Program.

The roadmaps are built using [Draw.io](https://www.draw.io/). Project file can be found at `/src` directory. To modify it, open draw.io, click **Open Existing Diagram** and choose `xml` file with project. It will open the roadmap for you, update it, upload and update the images in readme and create a PR (export as png).
