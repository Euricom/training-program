## .NET Developer Roadmap

When you are new to .NET development, you should start here.

### Learn C#
C# is not the only language one can use for developing applications with the .NET framework, but it _is_ the most widespread one. <br>
Get used to the C# syntax without installing anything:

- [C# Quickstarts](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/quick-starts/) - These quickstart excersises can be run in the browser!

    > Note: The last quickstart (Introduction to classes) requires a local development environment.<br>
    > But you should be able to complete the exercise with an online code editor like [.NET Fiddle](https://dotnetfiddle.net/).

- [.NET Academy](https://dotnetcademy.net/CSharp) - Interactive, browser based tutorials.
- [Tour of C#](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/tour-of-csharp/index) - Excellent guide to the langue and its concepts.

### Set up your environment

Now that you have a basic understanding of the language, it's time to set up a local development environment, if you haven't already:
