Hi Sacha!

Congratulations! You are now a member of MongoDB's startup accelerator. I'm Francesca and I'll be your point-person on the program. Be sure to join our community Slack to stay in touch with our community and ask questions directly from the team. 

I am SO curious about Homepass. Can you provide me with some more information on what you do? Possibly an investor deck? I am really curious about your business, how to discovered this problem in property buying-building and ownership, and would love to learn more!!!! 

Next Steps: 

Celebrate by tweeting the good news with the hashtag #MongoDBStartups! We'll be sure to RT you!

Getting your Atlas credits

As you know, a key component of this program is complimentary access to MongoDB Atlas . You will need to apply your codes before December 31, 2018 for you to claim their full value. You will have $3,000 worth of credit to use with the code ACCELERATOR-PH-OHTH3T. If you need some guidance on getting started with Atlas, check out our resource guide, or reach out to me directly! I'll help you answer your first question: Where do I put my coupon code? If you are currently on another DBaaS provider, we offer a free live migration tool that makes the process super easy!

Once you've created your Atlas account, please send me your group name. 

Let me know if you have any questions or need any help getting started. Welcome to the program!
